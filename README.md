# MEASUREMENT-OF-ENERGY-USING-SINGLE-PHASE-ENERGY-METER

## Aim:
To measure energy using Single Phase Energy Meter

## Procedure:
**Step 1:** Make Connections as per the instructions given below:

1. S1 of MCB - A1 of Ammeter and A2 of Ammeter - V1 of Voltmeter
2. V1 of Voltmeter - Mw of Wattmeter and Mw of Wattmeter - C of Wattmeter
3. S2 of MCB - V of Wattmeter and V of Wattmeter - N1 of Energy Meter
4. N2 of Energy Meter - L2 of Load and Le of Energy Meter - L1 of Load
5. L of Wattmeter - M of Energy Meter and S2 of MCB - V2 of Voltmeter

**NOTE : If wire is wrongly connected, Click on node number to detach the wire.**

**Step 2:** Click on   CHECK  button for checking the connections.

**Step 3:** Click on the mcb off MCB to Turn ON mcb on the supply.

**Step 4:** Select the number of Bulbs from the Lamp Load.

**Step 5:** Count the number of times Green LED blinks in 1 min (Meter Counter) by using 'Stopwatch'.

**Step 6:** Enter the number of times Green LED blinks in 1 min (Meter Counter).

**Step 7:** Click on ADD button to add the readings to the Observation Table.

**Step 8:** Add different readings to the table by selecting different number of bulbs.

**Step 9:** Click on PRINT button to print the webpage.

**Step 10:** Click on RESET button to refresh the webpage.

## Formula:
Actual Energy (A) = V*I*T /1000     kw-hr

Recorded Energy (R) = Number of Impulse (1min)/Meter Constant

Meter Constant = 3200 Imp/kw-hr

Relative Error = R−A /A *100%

Enter the no. of times Green LED blinks in 1min(Meter Counter):
